            <br>Colloquially known as “the Land of Kings”, Rajasthan is located in northern India and is the country's largest state.  Beyond the shadows of historic forts and grand palaces that adorn cities like Jodhpur, roughly three-quarters of the Rajasthan’s population of 68 million people live in rural areas. <br><br><input type="submit" value="Continue" class="navigate-right"/></i>

            <h2>Your Story</h2>
            <br>In a small village, in the southern part of the state, Ajay and Sapna, are starting their life together. The marriage of Ajay, 19, and Sapna, 17, was arranged by their parents. Ajay has seven years of schooling and can read, while Sapna, who did not get past an elementary education, is illiterate. Like most of the rural population, they work as subsistence farmers, on the same four acres of land that Ajay inherited from his parents.<br><br><input type="submit" value="Continue" class="navigate-right"/>

Factors that affect family composition include the health and gender of living children. The decision to have children (when, how many) is also hugely impacted by social norms and the actions of neighbors and family members. For the most part, the decision to have more children is a calculated economic decision. The decision dynamic is: more children aid in work around the house and are an investment in the future (can take care in old age), but more children incur education, health, dowry, and food costs, and can eventually be counterproductive in the home. In general, male babies are more desirable than female babies, leading to a trend of sex-selective abortion. It is quite common for women to discover the gender of their child via ultrasound, which runs around 300 Indian rupees. The decision to have an abortion often involves the desires of the father’s parents, although the decision can also jointly be made by the couple, as well. Home methods of abortion do exist, but are not as common as many women are aware that they are harmful/unreliable. Abortions run around 1,000-2,000 Indian rupees, which is often considered affordable in terms of money-saved by not having the child. 
<br><br>
For girls: cost of education, cost of health, cost of food, cost of dowry, aid around the house<br>
For boys: cost of education, cost of health, cost of food, aid around the house, pay-off with dowry/job<br>
<br><br>
For girls, education is a plateau (primary education is desirable to a certain point [literacy], but beyond primary skills, it gets to the point where it is more beneficial for the girl to be at home working, learning household skills)
For boys, more education increases job potential, generally seen as a good thing
<br><br>
All in all, decisions concerning children is a hugely calculated choice.
