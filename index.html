                <div>Poverty has remained stubbornly persistent, and the path out of it is rarely clear. &nbsp;But solutions are not as far away as they might seem, though they are not always intuitive.</div>

            <br>Clloquially known as “the Land of Kings”, Rajasthan is located in northern India and is the country's largest state.  Beyond the shadows of historic forts and grand palaces that adorn cities like Jodhpur, roughly three-quarters of the Rajasthan’s population of 68 million people live in rural areas. <br><br><input type="submit" value="Continue" class="navigate-right"/></i>

            <h2>Your Story</h2>
            <br>In a small village, in the southern part of the state, Ajay and Sapna, are starting their life together. The marriage of Ajay, 19, and Sapna, 17, was arranged by their parents. Ajay has seven years of schooling and can read, while Sapna, who did not get past an elementary education, is illiterate. Like most of the rural population, they work as subsistence farmers, on the same four acres of land that Ajay inherited from his parents.<br><br><input type="submit" value="Continue" class="navigate-right"/>

 <h2>Outcome</h2>

Many of the poor support their other neighbors, family, or people in their ethnic group when they suffer by lending them food or allowing them to take some. This establishes an informal solidarity network. [Citation needed]<br><br>
